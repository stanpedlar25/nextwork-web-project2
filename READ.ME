NextWork Web Application – CI/CD Pipeline (AWS)
Overview

This project demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline for a Java-based web application, built and deployed on AWS using native DevOps services. The pipeline automates build, test, and deployment stages triggered by changes pushed to GitHub.

The focus of this project is on understanding how AWS CI/CD services integrate end-to-end in a real deployment workflow.

Why this project

To gain hands-on experience building CI/CD pipelines using AWS-native tools

To understand how source control, build, and deployment stages work together

To practise deploying application updates automatically with minimal manual intervention

Architecture / Pipeline Flow

Code changes are pushed to the GitHub repository

AWS CodePipeline detects the change and triggers the pipeline

AWS CodeBuild builds the application using Maven (buildspec.yml)

Build artifacts are passed to AWS CodeDeploy

CodeDeploy deploys the application to an EC2 instance running Apache Tomcat

The pipeline is designed to validate that even small changes (e.g. updates to index.jsp) are automatically built and deployed.

Technologies Used

AWS CodePipeline – CI/CD orchestration

AWS CodeBuild – build and test stage

AWS CodeDeploy – automated deployment to EC2

AWS EC2 – application hosting

Apache Tomcat – web application server

Maven – build tool

GitHub – source control

Linux – deployment environment

Repository Structure

src/main – application source code

scripts/ – CodeDeploy lifecycle scripts

buildspec.yml – CodeBuild build instructions

appspec.yml – CodeDeploy deployment configuration

pom.xml – Maven project configuration

How it was built

CI/CD pipeline configured using AWS CodePipeline

Build stage defined with CodeBuild and Maven

Deployment automated using CodeDeploy lifecycle hooks

Application tested by triggering deployments via GitHub commits

What I’d improve next

Add automated testing into the build stage

Implement blue/green or rolling deployments

Add monitoring and alerts using Amazon CloudWatch

Containerise the application using Docker
